    This presentation is a birthday invitation that I created for a client. The invitation was designed to be warm and inviting,
    with a focus on nostalgia and celebration. I used a variety of elements to create a fun and playful atmosphere, 
    including colorful balloons, confetti, and a festive font. The invitation was created using a customizable template from Canva 1,
    which allowed me to tailor the design to the client’s specific needs. Overall,
    I’m proud of how this project turned out and I think it’s a great example of my ability to create engaging and visually appealing designs.

    This presentation is titled “Great Movies Rank” and features a list of the top three movies of the year. 
    The presentation provides a concise overview of each movie’s plot and themes. 
    The three movies featured in the presentation are “Time Travel,” “Top Gun,” and “Deep Space.”
    The presentation is visually appealing and easy to read, with each movie title accompanied by a brief description.
